{"instruction": "Explain MITRE ATT&CK T1566.001.", "output": "MITRE ATT&CK T1566.001 refers to 'Spearphishing Attachment'. Adversaries send spearphishing emails with malicious attachments (e.g., documents, executables) to gain initial access. These attachments, when opened, can execute code, install malware, or prompt for credentials, often bypassing security controls due to their targeted nature."}
{"instruction": "What is a zero-day vulnerability?", "output": "A zero-day vulnerability is a software flaw that is unknown to the vendor (developer) and has no public patch or fix available. Attackers discover and exploit these vulnerabilities 'on day zero' before the vendor is aware or has a chance to develop a patch, making them highly dangerous."}
{"instruction": "How does ransomware typically spread?", "output": "Ransomware commonly spreads through phishing emails with malicious attachments or links, compromised remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections, or exploitation of vulnerable public-facing services. Once executed, it encrypts files and demands a ransom for decryption."}
{"instruction": "Identify common IoCs for a phishing attack.", "output": "Common Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for a phishing attack include suspicious sender email addresses, misspelled domains in links, unusual grammar/phrasing, generic greetings, urgent or threatening language, and unexpected attachments (e.g., .zip, .exe, .js)."}
{"instruction": "Summarize the CISA advisory on Log4Shell exploitation (CVE-2021-44228).", "output": "The CISA advisory on Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) urges organizations to immediately patch Apache Log4j to version 2.17.1 or later. It highlights active exploitation by various threat actors, including state-sponsored groups, for remote code execution and initial access. Mitigation also involves specific configurations for affected applications."}
